# Guillotine Game - JavaFX Adaptation

## Overview

This project is a **JavaFX adaptation** of the card game **Guillotine**, set during the times of the French Revolution. Players compete to score points by claiming the most notable beheadings from a lineup of nobility. The game is strategic, allowing players to alter the order of the cards to maximize their score. 

The goal is to collect high-value cards such as **Marie Antoinette** while using strategic moves to outplay opponents. The game ends when all cards are drawn, and the player with the most points wins.
