# Guillotine Game - JavaFX Adaptation

## Overview

This project is a **JavaFX adaptation** of the card game **Guillotine**, set during the times of the French Revolution. Players compete to score points by claiming the most notable beheadings from a lineup of nobility. The game is strategic, allowing players to alter the order of the cards to maximize their score. 

The goal is to collect high-value cards such as **Marie Antoinette** while using strategic moves to outplay opponents. The game ends when all cards are drawn, and the player with the most points wins.

## Key Features

- **Card Game Mechanics**: Players take turns rearranging a lineup of 20 nobility cards, drawn from a deck of 40, to maximize their score.
- **Strategic Gameplay**: Players can modify the order of cards in the lineup to benefit themselves or hinder opponents.
- **Point System**: Cards have different point values, with special cards like **Marie Antoinette** and others that gain points based on specific collections.
- **Multiplayer**: The game progresses as each player completes their turn by taking a card, and play continues until no cards remain.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The game logic is written in Java.
- **JavaFX**: Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI) and visualizing the gameâ€™s card lineup and interactions.

## How to Play

1. On their turn, each player can manipulate the order of the lineup to their advantage.
2. The turn is completed by selecting a card from the lineup.
3. Certain cards have higher point values, and others depend on the number of similar cards collected.
4. The game ends when all cards are drawn, and the player with the most points is declared the winner.
