                            <p>Hello, I am an undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University, pursuing a B.S. 
								in Computer Science with a minor in Computer Gaming. My focus is on software engineering, 
								and I am passionate about AI, game design, and VR technology.
							</p>
							<p>From a young age, I have been fascinated by computer technology and enjoy tackling challenging 
								and creative projects. My current work includes developing digital twin environments with Unity 3D and 
								NVIDIA Omniverse, designing full-stack applications, and creating interactive games Unity and C#. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Outside of my technical interests, I enjoy playing baseball, watching movies, and finding new places to eat. 
								I am actively seeking summer internship opportunities to further expand my skills and contribute to innovative projects. 
								Please feel free to reach out to me through any of the contact details below.
							</p>

                            <p>I currently work as an undergraduate researcher for the <a href="https://www.casfer.us/">CASFER Engineering Research Center</a> at Case Western. 
								The purpose of our project is to harness computational power to create and analyze a nation-wide geospatial water data set, with the aim of 
								building a nitrogen reclamation system to help preserve the environment and benefit farmers.
							</p>
							<p> On the team, I work to collect new datasets and categorize metadata to be used for data verification and eventual integration into the research database. 
								My goal is to create an automated process for metadata categorization that will help expedite data analysis for researchers in our lab and on other projects.
